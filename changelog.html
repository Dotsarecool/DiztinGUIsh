    <h2 id="v1020">v1.0.2.0</h2>

    <p>Released ???.</p>

    <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Pressing U, H, and N now works as intended to jump to the first, nearest previous, and nearest next unreached blocks in the disassembly.</li>
        <li>The tab ordering for all elements of each window has been improved, instead of being seemingly random.</li>
        <li>Sub windows will now always appear on top of the main window instead of being somewhere seemingly random.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Changes</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Important:</strong> The project file format has been updated, so old projects will be converted automatically. Make a backup just in case.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>New Features</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Added the Label List Window, which allows you to see all labels currently in the disassembly in one place. In this window, you can even assign labels to non-ROM addresses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="v1010">v1.0.1.0</h2>

    <p>Released September 12, 2019.</p>

    <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Fixed some errors with displaying the main table near the end of the ROM.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error with opening ROMs of sizes of non-powers of 2.</li>
        <li>Fixed the intermediate address not showing for unreached bytes.</li>
        <li>Fixed an annoying error that would occur when saving a project where an alias or comment has been created then deleted.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error when jumping to the previous unreached block when no block exists.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error with the log generator that would create aliases on offsets that aren't instructions, pointers, or read points.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error that occurs when auto generating aliases for two vectors with the same offset.</li>
        <li>The data bank register column will now properly be highlighted in red when a MVP or MVN instruction is executed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Changes</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Changed the "Effective Address" column and related things to "Intermediate Address," and fixed some instructions' calculations for the intermediate address. See the help file for more details.</li>
        <li>Changed the hotkey of "Goto Effective Address" (F) to "Goto Intermediate Address" (T) to match the name change.</li>
        <li>Renamed "View" to "Tools" and added an "Options" submenu.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>New Features</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>New mapping modes have been added. ExLoROM and SuperFX mapping modes are available and automatically detected. Two SA-1 mapping modes are also available thanks to Vitor Vilela. Mode 2, Super MMC (used with the S-DD1 and SPC7110 chips), is an option, but it is not supported yet.</li>
        <li>Added "Move with Step" option that makes the selected row jump to the end of an Auto Step or Mark Many process.</li>
        <li>Added support for opening and saving *.dizraw project files. These are just normal project files, but they are uncompressed.</li>
    </ul>
